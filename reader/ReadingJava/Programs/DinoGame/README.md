# Dino Game

Put this class into a java project and run it. It will open a window with a game that you can play using the arrow keys.

Now, restructure the game according to SOLID principles. 
You can create new classes, interfaces, methods, etc. 
You can also change the existing code.

The game should work the same way as before, but it should be easier to understand and maintain.

Make sure you commit your work.
