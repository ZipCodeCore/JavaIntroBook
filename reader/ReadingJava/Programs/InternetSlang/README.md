# Internet Slang

This is a terrible piece of code.

One file, all the code in one method, except for `AVL`.

What is AVL doing? Why is it there? WHY is it in the middle of this code?
How come it's not in its own file? Should it be?

What is the `Node` class doing? Why is it there?

Refactor this code into a more readable format.
Make sure the code is easy to understand and maintain.

Reduce all those `avl.create` calls into some more rational (like a loop, that reads them all from a file, or something).

Create some unit tests that can exercise the AVL class. 


# Hints on how to refactor

- Create a new class for the `AVL` tree.
- Create a new class for the `Node` class.
- Create a new class for the `InternetSlang` class.
- Create a new class for the `Main` class.

# Requirements

- The code should be easy to understand and maintain.
- The code should be well-organized.
- The code should be well-documented.
- The code should be tested.


_Get it running in a java project, then start making changes.
