# Marvel Avengers Game

Can you get this mess of a code to work? It's a simple text-based game where you can choose a character and fight against a villain. The game is not working correctly, and you need to fix the bugs to make it functional.

- Create a proper repo for this code.
- Put it into a maven project called `MarvelAvengersGame`.
- Get it running

- Organize the code into cleaner, easier to follow structures and methods.
- Move all those damn images into a `resource` folder. Make sure it still works.
