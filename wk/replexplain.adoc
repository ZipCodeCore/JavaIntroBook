A "REPL" is a special kind of program. 
It allows you to type in a Javascript program, run it, and see what happens.
Even though it is simple and easy to use, it is a pretty powerful computer programming tool.

The one we've created for your use, _https://code.zipcode.rocks_, let you type in various JavaScript programs and run them showing you the results.

Let's try the sample on that is built-in to the REPL page.
Use a browser to go to the URL _https://code.zipcode.rocks_.
You should see something like:

Take a look at the black section.
What does it say?

Notice the two sections of blue buttons, click the one that says *Run Javascript*. (It's in the middle of the page).
Now, what does the black section say?

That is how you run JavaScript in this REPL.

Now, what does *REPL* stand for? Well, it means "Read Evaluate Print Loop" (R-E-P-L).
A REPL is a program that reads in your code (here it is JavaScript), evaluates what it means, and then prints out any output the program might have.
Here, we are using the command _console.log()_ to print out a series of output values.


=== Editing JavaScript Code

In the REPL window, the blue part, you can change the JavaScript code.
It works like a text editor or a word processor.

Change Line 1 in the blue section from "Hello World" to "Hello YourName" (see, I've changed _World_ to _Kris_) (and use your real name there, not _YourName_).

Now click the blue *Run Javascript* button, what did the black section change to??

Pretty cool, huh?

Notice that the source code is several colors.
This is because many code editing programs today, like our REPL here, use different colors to point out different parts of the JavaScript program.
Here, numbers are in orange, Strings are in green, and special JavaScript _reserved words_ are in a pinkish color.
This _syntax coloring_ is used to indicate extra information to the coder.

=== A First Program

Let's write your first program.
First, click the *Select All Code* blue button.
Second, click the *Delete Selected Code* blue button.
This empties the blue editor of all the code that was there.

Now, type onto line 1,

[source]
----
console.log("My First Program!");
----

Take care to notice the double quotes (") AND notice the semicolon (;) at the end of the line.

And now click the *Run Javascript* blue button.
What does the black output section say now?

Does it look like this?

Congratulations!
You've just written a Javascript program.

Maybe you are Zip Code material after all.

=== Coding Assessments

To attend a Zip Code Wilmington cohort, 
Zip Code asks you to complete a JavaScript coding assessment.
Usually, this is done on a website like HackerRank.
By asking you to solve some pretty simple programming challenges, we get a chance to see 
how you do when learning something entirely new.
The ability to learn new and different things continually is a very important aspect of 
building a professional career as a coder.
As you will see, if you do make coding a professional endeavor, learning is 
something you will do all the time.
