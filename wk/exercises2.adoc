=== Area of a Triangle
  
image::TriangleArea.png[Triangle]

The area of a triangle is calculated using the following function:

****
Area = (h*b)/2
****

where Area represents the area, h represents the height perpendicular to the length of its base, b.

----
if h = 6 and b = 4,
(6 * 4) is 24
24 / 2 is 12
= 12
----

----
What is Area, if h = 4 and b = 5 ?
What is Area, if h = 2 and b = 6 ?
----

What do you need to do to this function to make it use the triangle equation?

[source]
----
function triangleArea(h, b) {
    area = 0;
    return area
}

console.log(triangleArea(4,5));
console.log(triangleArea(2,6));
----

=== Javascript Math

If asked to write a function to calculate and return a number divided by 2, you would code

----
function f(x) {
    return x / 2;
}
----

*x* is the parameter, the number we want to divide by 2. We just `return x / 2`. 
So if x=6, the number returned by the function will be *3*.

If asked to produce a function that calculated a more complicated expression, perhaps

****
234 * 76 / 89 * 564
****

You could just write

----
function whoa() {
    return 234 * 76 / 89 * 564;
}
----

If asked to produce a function that calculated a more complicated expression, perhaps

****
234 * 76 / 89 * 564
****

You could just write

----
function whoa() {
    return 234 * 76 / 89 * 564;
}

Use these as *patterns* to solve the problems below.

Complete the function to calculate multiplication of two input values. 4 x 4 should print 16.

----
function multiply(x, y) {
    return 0;
}
----

Write a simple function that returns the remainder (modulus) of the following equation:  118 % 31

----
function foo() {
    return 0;
}
----

Using Arithmetic Operators, write a function to return the product of 789 x 123.

----
function m() {
    return 0;
}
----

Complete the function to calculate the square of an input value. 
Remember that the square of a number is the result of multiplying that number times itself.

----
function square(y) {
    return 0;
}
----

=== Variables

Variables, as you will remember, allow a program to "name" various data and keep track of it as it changes during the running of a program.
You can imagine that a computer game which tracks the scores of each player, would keep these values in variables as the game is played.

Write a function *one* which creates a variable called *t* with the value 1024 and return the variable.

----
function one() {



}
----

Write out a series of JavaScript variables.


----
a variable named foot equal to 12
a variable named fingers equal to 4
a variable named thumb equal to 1
a variable name isPlayerAlive equal to true
a variable named speed equal to 55.0
a variable named playerOne equal to a string "Joe"
a variable named PI equal to 3.14159
a variable named hand equal to 2 times fingers plus 2 times thumbs
----

=== Functions

==== String

Make a function that returns the string value "Zip Code" from the given function.

----

----

==== Length of String

Using the JavaScript length method, return the length of the string "ZipCodeRocks" using the given function.
 
Example 1
input: "hello".length
output: 5
 
Example 2
input: "Delaware"
output: 8

=== Array

An array is a list of some kind of data. 
Here is an example of an array of fruits.

[source]
----
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

console.log( fruits[0] ); // Apple
console.log( fruits[1] ); // Orange
console.log( fruits[2] ); // Plum
----

Notice how the phrase *fruits[0]* prints out just *Apple* from the array.
The list of fruits is *ordered*, and *indexed* from 0 to 2.
We can also find out the length of the array by asking for its *length* property.

[source]
----
console.log( fruits.length ); // 3
----

Now, use a *for* loop to print out each item of our *fruits* array.

First, need to build an empty function.

[source]
----
function printFruits() {
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
}
----

Second, we need to put in a loop that step through each string in the array.

[source]
----
function printFruits() {
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
    for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
        
    }
}
----

And finally, we print out each item in the array.

[source]
----
function printFruits() {
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
    for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
        console.log( fruits[i] );
    }
}
----

Before you try to solve this next problem, spend some time reviewing

.Swap Two Elements
--
Complete the function below to swap two elements in an array and return the result. Your function should take three parameters: An array and two integers. The integers are the indexes of the two elements in the array you should swap.
 
Example 1:
 
Input:
[7,4,9,3,6,2], 4, 2
 
Output:
[7,4,6,3,9,2],
--

=== First and Last

This problem is a little harder.
We need to take a string and copy out the first an last letters, and then return them reversed in order and with a space in between them.

[sidebar]
.First and Last
--
Given a string, create a new string made up of its first and last letters, reversed and separated by a space.

Example
Given the word 'bat', return 't b'.
Given the word 'motor', return 'r m'.
 
Function Description 
Complete the function lastLetters in the editor below.
 
lastLetters has the following parameter(s):
    string word:  a string to process
 
Returns:
    string: a string of two space-separated characters
 
Constraint
2 ≤ length of word ≤ 100

=== Sum a List of Numbers

Below, we will be using a list of numbers.
Imagine we have an array of numbers like this:

[source]
----
let numbers = [3, 8, 5, 7, 9, 2, 13];
----

[sidebar]
.Sum an Array
--
Calculate the sum of an array of integers.
 
Example
numbers = [3, 8, 5, 7, 9, 2, 13]
 
The sum is 3 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 2 + 13 = 47.
 
Function Description 
Complete the function arraySum in the editor below.
 
arraySum has the following parameter(s):
    int numbers[n]: an array of integers
Returns
    int: integer sum of the numbers array
--

This problem expects us to make a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

How are we going to do this?

Well, the first thing to solve this problem is to setup the function we will be writing.

[source]
----
function arraySum(aList) {

}
----

Okay, now we know we have to figure out the result of all the addition. 
Let's set up a variable called *runningSum* and set it to zero, and at the end of the function, return it as the result of the function.
This will not give a working program yet, but it is meant to show how you can step through writing the function bit by bit.

[source]
----
function arraySum(aList) {
    let runningSum = 0;

    return runningSum;
}
----

This step by step fashion is very useful to get some of the fundamental pieces of the solution out of the way.

Now, we need to figure out how to _step through the array_ and adding each number we find in there to the *runningSum* variable.
To do that we are going use a *loop*.
This *for* loop takes the *aList* parameter and _for each_ item in *aList*, assigns it to *n*.
We then add *n* to our *runningSum*.
At the end of the loop, we return the value of *runningSum*.

[source]
----
function arraySum(aList) {
    let runningSum = 0;

    for (let n of aList) {
        runningSum = runningSum + n;
    }
    return runningSum;
}
----

And when we test it, it should give us the right answer. (Use the REPL to see)

[source]
----
function arraySum(aList) {
    let runningSum = 0;

    for (let n of aList) {
        runningSum = runningSum + n;
    }

    return runningSum;
}

let numbers = [3, 8, 5, 7, 9, 2, 13];

console.log( arraySum(numbers) ); // answer should be 47.
----

Now, you change the loop used to the *for* loop with an index, and test it out.

[source]
----
function arraySum(aList) {
    let runningSum = 0;

    // use a loop which has an index *i* and uses *aList[i]* to get each number.

    return runningSum;
}

let numbers = [3, 8, 5, 7, 9, 2, 13];

console.log( arraySum(numbers) ); // answer should be 47.
----
