=== For Loop

The *for* loop is more complex, but itâ€™s also the most commonly used loop.

[source]
----
for (begin; condition; step) {

    // execute the code statements 
    // in the loop body

}
----

Here's one where we go from 1 to 5.

[source]
----
for(let j = 1; j < 6;  j++){
    // loop body code
    console.log(j);
}
----

This loop will print out: 

[source]
----
// print 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
----

Notice how there are THREE parts to the FOR loop's mechanism. 

* begin: j = 1  // Executes once upon entering the loop.
* condition: j < 6  // Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.
* loop step: j++  // Executes after the body on each iteration.

and

* body:	console.log()  // Runs again and again while the condition is true.

Let's show you another glimpse of the *break* statement.

for(let p = 1; p < 6; p++){
    if(p === 4){
        break;
    }
console.log("Loop " + p + " times");
}	
----

Jumps out of the loop when p is equal to 4.



[TIP]
====
* Print from 10 to 1 with a for loop and a while loop (hint use decrement)
* Write a loop that prints 1 - 5 but break out at 3

* Go back to Arrays
* Look at an array of donuts
* Create an array of donuts
* Loop through the array of donuts and print each donut string
====

You can do it, I know you can!

for(let x = 0; x < donuts.length; x++){
    console.log(donuts[x]);
}

If you had something like this, buy yourself a donut, you deserve it.
