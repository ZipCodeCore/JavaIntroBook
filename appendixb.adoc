== Mars Lander

This is some code to show you how you might write a simple mars lander simulation in JavaScript. It's taken from history, way back in the 1970's - this idea was passed around as some of the very first open source programs.

Meant as an example of a longer program (159 lines) to get you thinking, it's really not very complicated. 
The general idea is you have a series of "burns" in a list, and the game (or simulator, if you will) steps through the list applying each burn. 
If you run out of altitude (or height) while you're going too fast, you will crash.

The tricky bit would be for you to figure out what `burnArray` would be used to safely land at a vehicle speed 1 or 2. That could be hard.
