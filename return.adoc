==  Return statement

The *return* statement is a very simple one. It just finishes the running of code in the current function and "returns" to the function's caller.

As you have seen, _functions_ are used to make code more understandable, cleaner and more organized. Say we have a couple of functions in our program:

[source]
----
let minorHit = 3;
let majorHit = 7;

function adjustHealth(player, hit) {
    player.health = player.health - hit;

    if (isAlive(player) == false) {
        return playerDead;
    }

    return playerAlive;
} 

function isAlive(player, hit) {
    if (player.health >= 20) {
        return true;
    } else { // player has died!
        return false;
    }
} 

----

If someplace in our code we were to do something like:

[source]
----
// big hit!
continuePlaying = adjustHealth(playerOne, majorHit);

if (continuePlaying == playerDead) endGame();
----

You can see how when we call the function "adjustHealth()" it returns either playerAlive or playerDead, and we make a decision to end the game if the player has died.

Notice too, you can have multiple return statements in functions, and each one can return a different value if that's what you need.
